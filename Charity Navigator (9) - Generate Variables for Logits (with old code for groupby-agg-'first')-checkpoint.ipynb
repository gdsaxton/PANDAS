    "In this notebook you'll see code used to conduct the following steps:\n",
    "- Read in merged current/historical/2011 dataset with all BMF and SOI data: \n",
    "  - **_merged data with EIN clean-up, SOI data, and 2015, 2008, and 2004 BMF data.pkl_**\n",
    "  - There are 84,958 rows in this dataset, including some years for which only SOI data are included. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Notes:_**\n",
    "- Of the 8,304 organizations in the dataset, 4,857 are those that were rated in 2011.\n",
    "  - 582 of the 5,439 2011 organizations have been dropped by CN, leaving 4,857\n",
    "- The dataset is organized in a **_org/FY/ratings system_** format \n",
    "  - i.e., one row per organization for each fiscal year, with multiple rows per org/FY when there has been a ratings system change from *CN 1.0* to *CN 2.0* to *CN 2.1.* \n",
    "  - Some organizations will have more than one entry per fiscal year -- even for the same ratings system (CN2.1, CN2.0, or CN1.0) -- multiple ratings per year are triggered by amended 990s, etc.); e.g., https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&orgid=10166\n",
    "- The baseline for the dataset is data gathered from each organization's *Historical Ratings* page -- you'll see the same number of rows -- and same data for each row -- as seen on those pages; e.g, https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&orgid=10166\n",
    "- What I've done is to merge each organization's current *Rating Profile* into this *org/FY/ratings system* dataset, as seen here: https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10166\n",
    "- I have merged/appended in two rows of data for each organization:\n",
    "  - **_current ratings_** -- data scraped from the *Rating Profile* in August 2016.\n",
    "  - **_2011 data_** -- data scraped from the *Rating Profile* in October 2011.\n",
    "- So, for *SOX policy data*, we have two years' of data -- 2011 and 2016. For all years, we have what is on the *Historical Ratings* page -- namely, the overall numerical score, the overall numerical star rating, and whether the organization was under a donor advisory that year. \n",

    "- 1st and 2nd tests can be robustness analyses\n",
    "- Focus on 4th and 5th tests\n",
    "- Control variables:\n",
    "  - Size: total revenues best (probably logged)\n",
    "    - will need 2011 and 2016 versions for the 4th and 5th tests\n",

    "        - CN does not include that information in the ratings area, but it is included on the webpage in the 'breadcrumbs' area\n",
    "  - The focus of our paper is on SOC policies; if an org has SOX policies it probably has other governance policies, and these would be highly correlated. So, we will leave the other governance variables out of one version of the 4th and 5th tests, and then try to include them in another set. The best candidates are:\n",
    "    - *independent board* --> related to Erica's *independence of key actors\" concept\n",
    "    - *board review of 990* and *audited financials* --> both related to Erica's *board monitoring* concept\n",
    "    - we could include other governance variables as needed.\n",
    "- We are focusing on non-health, non-university organizations; by focusing more on a donor-focused sample (CN), we are differentiating the work from previous studies.\n",
    "- To differentiate from Erica's *JBE* paper, we should use the SOI data to see how many of the donor advisories are because of 'non-material diversions'.\n",

    "- Number of 2016 orgs (n=8,304) not in 2011 ratings: 3,447\n",
    "- In 2011 when I scraped the current ratings there are 39 blank rows. Specifically, I checked the following spreadsheet: *Charity Navigator - current ratings, October 18, 2011 (WITH UPDATES FOR DONOR ADVISORY ORGS).xlsx*  -- 39 rows were blank for all ratings information, so I checked against the historical ratings on the CN website. (So far) all rows were either 1) dropped from CN, 2) had a donor advisory, or 3) still have a donor advisory. I have 5,439 orgs in the 2011 database. 39 seem to have had donor advisories on them at that time. So, the 2011 sample is the 5,400 orgs that did not have an advisory on them at the time. This conforms with the *n* of 5,400 in the above logit."
