    "- Do not do 3rd or 6th test -- benefit not worth the cost\n",
    "- 1st and 2nd tests can be robustness analyses\n",
    "- Focus on 4th and 5th tests\n",
    "- Control variables:\n",
    "  - Size: total revenues best (probably logged)\n",
    "    - will need 2011 and 2016 versions for the 4th and 5th tests\n",
    "  - efficiency ratio\n",
    "  - age (from BMF)\n",

    "        - CN does not include that information in the ratings area, but it is included on the webpage in the 'breadcrumbs' area\n",
    "  - The focus of our paper is on SOC policies; if an org has SOX policies it probably has other governance policies, and these would be highly correlated. So, we will leave the other governance variables out of one version of the 4th and 5th tests, and then try to include them in another set. The best candidates are:\n",
    "    - *independent board* --> related to Erica's *independence of key actors\" concept\n",
    "    - *board review of 990* and *audited financials* --> both related to Erica's *board monitoring* concept\n",
    "    - we could include other governance variables as needed.\n",
    "- We are focusing on non-health, non-university organizations; by focusing more on a donor-focused sample (CN), we are differentiating the work from previous studies.\n",
    "- To differentiate from Erica's *JBE* paper, we should use the SOI data to see how many of the donor advisories are because of 'non-material diversions'.\n",

    "- Code the *type* of advisory? Maybe save for future study\n",

    "- Number of 2016 orgs (n=8,304) not in 2011 ratings: 3,447\n",
    "- In 2011 when I scraped the current ratings there are 39 blank rows. Specifically, I checked the following spreadsheet: *Charity Navigator - current ratings, October 18, 2011 (WITH UPDATES FOR DONOR ADVISORY ORGS).xlsx*  -- 39 rows were blank for all ratings information, so I checked against the historical ratings on the CN website. (So far) all rows were either 1) dropped from CN, 2) had a donor advisory, or 3) still have a donor advisory. I have 5,439 orgs in the 2011 database. 39 seem to have had donor advisories on them at that time. So, the 2011 sample is the 5,400 orgs that did not have an advisory on them at the time. This conforms with the *n* of 5,400 in the above logit."
